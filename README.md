# miraging
The microRNA for aging project.

It includes two parts: the MIAGO ontology and RDF dataset that uses MIAGO's semantics.

Python code transferring spreadsheet of curated data to RDF/OWL format was included.

MIrna and AGing Ontology(MIAGO).  It represents the experiments that observe the functional miRNAs and target proteins in the aging domain. This ontology gives logical definitions to classify miRNA target based on both computational prediction and experimental validation.
